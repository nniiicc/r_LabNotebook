Collapse as defined by Joseph Tainter: “a rapid, significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity” ([31], p. 7). 


Further, Tainter describes collapse in terms of a loss in political complexity, including "...less flow of
information between individuals, between political and
economic groups, and between a center and its periphery;
less sharing, trading, and redistribution of resources; less
overall coordination and organization of individuals and
groups; a smaller territory integrated within a single
political unit” ([31], p. 4). 

Tomilson et al. thus begin the paper with the following, rather hefty claim "It is time to consider how the CHI community can help civilization react to, and perhaps plan for, global collapse." p.1

Define collapse informatics as :

> ...the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity."

Outlining previous work they state that much of "sustainable" HCI has been about either avoiding harmful effects of climate / environmental change, or adaptation to that change... they propose collapse informatics to apply to a third concern

> ...focusing on the role and potential effects of ICT in dealingwith changes—however induced—that create massive shifts in the way humanity must adapt to survive in its environments—political, social, and ecological.

This includes both preparation for, and adaptation to change (climate induced or otherwise).

Tomilson step through an interesting set of propositions:

- civilizations are a complex society
- society is a collection of cooperating individuals
- civilization that cooperates through globally distributes individuals or collectives is a 'global civilization'

They use this to argue for an HCI genre - which includes "concerns, goals, assumptions, and concepts." By genre they mean:  

> “common frameworks that structure how researchers define
[a problem] and structure what is an appropriate solution”
(Disalvo et al. p. 1975). 

A strange quote here frames the "Scope, Concepts and Concern" section of this paper 

"“[w]hether or not humankind successfully navigates
itself away from the rocky shoals it faces will depend to no
small degree on whether the right type of
sociotechnological infrastructure is conceptualized,
developed and used” ([27], p. 63)."

`the right type irks me - it smacks of technologicalism. There isn't a right set of sociotechnical infrastructures - there are a number of important decisions we make in design, but right and wrong doesn't categorize them very meaningfully`

They move from a broad conversation in mitigation and adaptation to vulnerability, where they draw on work of Luers et al: 

> (a) the sensitivity of the system’s well-being (or its proxy) to
changes in the value of the environmental variable in
question and (b) the proximity of the system to a threshold
below which the system is said to be ‘damaged.’

`if ICT4D can do anything meaningful to engage with climate change, it is to decrease the length of a feedback loop in global energy system - or really ANY of the numerous finite resource systems that dominate our daily western life.`
