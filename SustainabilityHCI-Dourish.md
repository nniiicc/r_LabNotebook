from abstract: 

>Research on ecological politics and thepolitical economy of environmentalism highlight somemissing elements in contemporary HCI analysis, andsuggest some new directions for the relationship betweensustainability and HCI. In particular, I propose thatquestions of scale â€“ the scales of action and the scales of effects - might provide a useful new entry point for design practice.
ICT related sustainability work has been couched in terms of personal health and wellness, as well as "persuasive technologies"
The premise of this work is that global or environmental health might also be a site for technological interventions. 
Many HCI studies have been aimed at technology use (mobile computing) to either make people aware of their environmental impact (transit, purchase, or energy decision making) or to coordinate the collection of environmental data (citizen science, etc.) ... 
These studies focus primarily on individual as opposed to collective action... 
> This paper is motivated by the conviction that, in order toassess the potential and effectiveness of HCI interventionsin environmental practice, it is necessary to inquire into the contexts in which those practices arise, and to recognize thepotential contradictions between the goals of ourinterventions and the forces that shape their deployment.

Three related consideration are explored: 

1. HCI has often transformed the problems of sustainability into the cost-benefit trade-offs of rational actor economics, promotingsustainability as a matter of personal morality rather thanindustrial regulation or political mobilization.2. The politics of HCI interventions. 3. Scale as a potential method of gaining traction on these problems. 


In describing the idea of "envrionmentality" Dourish describes a problem within which design innovation "A similar argument could be made about design discourse, in which commitments to technological determinism and techno-social progress leave little room for the political and historical."

`essentially what I am arguing for is exactly that historical treatment`

Dourish notes that, the cultural logic of neolibralism  allows ofr markets to appear as natural rather than social constructions. 

Therefore, the typical design response is to frame sustainability in terms of informed choice...


Scales

...one alternative role for information technologies might be tohelp connect people at the scales at which environmentalaction and engagement can be effective.
