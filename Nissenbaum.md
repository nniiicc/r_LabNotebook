Traces interest in computing ethics back to “Bias in Computer Systems,” ACM Trans. Information Systems, July 1996, pp. 340-
346).

The article begins with a a simple proposition:  " Computer and information systems can embody values." How this happens is carried... 

> mystery lies in seeing values as part of technology,
a perspective not usually adopted by scholars and researchers who study the social, ethical, and political aspects of information technology. 

Nissenbaum puts forward to categories of studying ethics of computing: 

1. Focusing on social changes:  Values are not the controversy's central subject. For instance, automation of medical prescriptions does not call into question the ethics taking drugs, but questions the lines of responsibility and accountatibilty that are implicit in making those decisions... there is a question also of whether information technologies will cause even greater social injustice than we currently experience... 

2. ...Versus focusing on Values Themselves: technology's values form part of the controversy. New technologies create new challenges for traditional problems of privacy, intellectual property, etc. They also pose new categories of problems... 

The idea, traditionally is that computer and information systems impact our values... part of her argument is that this works in the opposite direction - values affect the shape of technologies. 

This is summarized in the following passage: 

> the values that systems and devices embody are not simply
a function of their objective shapes. We
must also study the complex interplay
between the system or device, those who
built it, what they had in mind, its conditions of use, and the natural, cultural, social, and political context in which it
is embedded — for all these factors may feature in an account of the values embodied in it.

In arguing for what equates to a Latourian "un-black boxing" she states " Sometimes
a fine-grained understanding of systems—
even down to gritty details of architecture,
algorithm, code, and possibly the under-
lying physical characteristics—plays an
essential part in describing and explain-
ing the social, ethical, and political dimen-
sions of new information technologies."

Nissenbaum claims that what cases like Napster can motivate is the joining of forces, between tech and non-tech populations, to make clear the relationship between systems features on the one hand and values on the other. 

We may be tempted to conclude from our computing
